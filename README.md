# Hippity Hoppity
Hippity Hoppity is an extremely difficult platformer game and is influenced by games such as 'Jump King' and 'Getting Over It'.
The game is my very first solo build and is made using Unity, most of the art assets were from open-source resources.
The story of the game is about a slippery frog training to become a ninja, in his training he hops from one platform to the next,
with the goal of eventually reaching the top. Each platform is part of a different zone, each with its own unique challenges.
Items can be bought in the store to assist the ninja, but in hindsight I may have made the game too difficult as none of my game
testers have managed to beat the game yet, let alone get the diamond medal at the end (Medals are given based on death count).
